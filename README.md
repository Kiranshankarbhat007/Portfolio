#### Data Science / Machine Learning Portfolio


# [Project 1: Pet Classification Model Using CNN.](https://github.com/Kiranshankarbhat007/Data-Science-and-ML-Projects-/blob/master/Deep_learning_pet_classification_project.ipynb)

   Build a CNN model that classifies the given pet images correctly into dog and 
cat images.

#### Tasks: 
   Import necessary packages and dataset, checking and cleaning the dataset, generating additional images from given set of images, converting the images to numpy array, reshaping 
the array, create, compile and optimize the model. 

#### Packages and Tools:
   Tensorflow with Keras, Pandas, Numpy, Sklearn, Matplotlib, ImageDataGenerator, img_to_array from Keras. Sequential Model with Convolutional Neural Network


# [Project 2: Comcast Telecom Consumer Complaints EDA](https://github.com/Kiranshankarbhat007/Data-Science-and-ML-Projects-/blob/master/ComCast%20.ipynb)

Comcast is an American global telecommunication company. The firm has be
en providing terrible customer service. They continue to fall short despite repeated promises 
to improve. Only last month (October 2016) the authority fined them a $2.3 million, after 
receiving over 1000 consumer complaints.
The existing database will serve as a repository of public customer complaints filed against 
Comcast. It will help to pin down what is wrong with Comcast's customer service.

#### Task: 
   Exploratory Data Analysis.

#### Packages and Tools: 
   Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
